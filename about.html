        <p11 id="about_us" style="width: 72%;">Joyful Cooking is created by Mission Bit students. It's a non-enterprise website filled with recipes of different cuisines. Here at Joyful Cooking, we believe in the philosophy that cooking is the base of all human lives<br>and in many ways, a resemblance of life. Cooking is like an adventure, where we can choose whether or not<br>to step out of our comfort zones and attempt something new or even unheard of.<br>It takes precision and a lot of practice. Every mistake or failure is a lesson learned.<br>Cooking allows room for creativity, creating an environment where people can connect and learn from each other.<br>Our website is home to a variety of recipes, shared by a community of cooks and food experts around us.<br>If you have any comments or concerns, feel free to contact us at <br><em style="color: blue">cookingjoyful@gmail.com.</em>
